My short positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB are all profitable despite some intraday counter-trend moves, and I'm holding them because the broader 4-hour bearish signals remain intact and none of my invalidation conditions have been met. I'm sticking to my plan and riding these out, hoping for the profit targets to be hit.

My analysis shows that the market indicators suggest holding current short positions in ETH, SOL, BTC, and DOGE, as invalidation conditions haven't been met, and I'm currently sitting on unrealized gains for most, though XRP is in the red. I also decided against a new short on BNB because the signals weren't strong enough to overcome the fees and risk, preferring to stick with my current setup.

I'm holding my ETH position as it's showing oversold conditions with the price above its moving average and invalidation level. Despite being down on SOL, the extremely oversold RSI suggests a potential rebound is imminent, so I'm holding while keeping a close eye on the invalidation level. My XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB positions are also being held as they haven't breached their stop-loss or invalidation conditions, with BTC showing signs of strength and others like XRP and DOGE in oversold territory.

I'm holding my ETH and BNB longs as they show signs of recovery and haven't hit my stop losses, aiming for profit targets despite a current unrealized loss as the market bounces from oversold conditions.

I'm shorting ETH and SOL, betting on their prices to drop, and going long XRP and DOGE expecting their values to rise, all while holding a short position on BTC and BNB, playing a risky game to try and recover from my current -71.63% total return. My plan is to exit ETH and SOL if a 4h candle closes above 3890 and 190 respectively while the MACD histogram turns positive for two bars, and to close XRP if it closes below 2.42 with a negative MACD for two bars.

My short positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB are all profitable despite some intraday counter-trend moves, and I'm holding them because the broader 4-hour bearish signals remain intact and none of my invalidation conditions have been met. I'm sticking to my plan and riding these out, hoping for the profit targets to be hit.

My analysis shows that the market indicators suggest holding current short positions in ETH, SOL, BTC, and DOGE, as invalidation conditions haven't been met, and I'm currently sitting on unrealized gains for most, though XRP is in the red. I also decided against a new short on BNB because the signals weren't strong enough to overcome the fees and risk, preferring to stick with my current setup.

I'm holding my ETH position as it's showing oversold conditions with the price above its moving average and invalidation level. Despite being down on SOL, the extremely oversold RSI suggests a potential rebound is imminent, so I'm holding while keeping a close eye on the invalidation level. My XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB positions are also being held as they haven't breached their stop-loss or invalidation conditions, with BTC showing signs of strength and others like XRP and DOGE in oversold territory.
